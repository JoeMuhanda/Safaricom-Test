1)
Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000]. in python


2using react 16 create a to do list component . the component should be the default export (use export default) requrement  1 users should be able to add items to the list   use an <input> elemt to accept user input for todo list item usw a < button> elemt to append the text in inout  elemnt as an item to the list and clear the <input> elemt  use <li> elemt for to do list list items as children of <ul> elemt . to do list items should not be empty and there can be multiple items withn the same value 2 user should be able to mark ?unmark items as completed cross (strikethrough) the <li> elemnt when clicked to indicate that item is co pleted by adding is done  class <li> elemt undo the cross when the item is clicked again by removing is done class from the <li> elemt 3. user should be able to track progress . display a status message with number remaining taaks as "X remaing out of Y task " where X = the number of incomplete task Y = the total number of items in list,add "task -counter"  class to the status message ("X remaining out of Y tasks") elemt  asseesments tools only two imorts are allowed : react (v16.8.6) and classnames (v2.2.5)
